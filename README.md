# French election 2017 : predicting the winner.

I gathered the french presidential vote for the first for each town in continental France (+- 35000 cities) and combined them with demographics and economics elements from the INSEE.

The resulting dataset is `elections_2017_First_round.csv.tar.gz`


For modeling and prediction, see `XGB_elections.Rmd`
